--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Background = background1 
-BS currently completing backgrounds will up load Saturday 5th
-They are cycled tiles as the moment... need MD to communicate on this
- have a specific scene for the Boss scenes .. see ginger peeps file, he has a ginger tree castle.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player sprite 
-BS uploaded draft see Lemon Guy Sprite_BS waiting for feedback from MD
- BS working on death scene, just bursts into a yellow puddle... also want to make a joke about yellow rain somewhere, maybe just add rain in a level and he can be like .. I hope thats rain ...
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Enemy general, need to discuss how many we need 
-BS Bad Guy ginger Peep uploaded peep draft for MD to comment will need to adjust size depending on what he is to do and also a death sequence that will need more work depending on his 
 function. 

-BS If we can do like mario and have like 'sorry but you lemon basket is in another castle, or what ever it is ... on each level and just match against ginger peep at the end, that would be easy for me timewise. Or could battle Ginger Peep at the end of each level...., changing his size or colour/he could get more burnt each battle. He could fly and drop lollies once, stand stationary pooping out shooting projectiles, and maybe could use Joshuas rock paper scissors code for the end? Otherwise there is about 40 hours of graphic design.

-BS if anyone else wants to sketch up a sprite we can bring them together graphically if needed.
