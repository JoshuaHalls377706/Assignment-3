Things To Consider: 
ASSIGNMENT REQUIREMENTS
• Q1 We all agreed to do a tkinter
     JBH - completed very sleek proffessional setup see Assignment 3 Q1 JBH.py 
     BS - will link the opening to my tkinter and produce custom collectable items for bonus points
     MD-
• Q2 A game with human-like characters (hero, enemy)
Create a simple “side-scrolling” 2D game using Pygame. The game should allow the player to control a character with the ability to run, jump, shoot projectiles. The game should have enemies, collectibles, and 3 levels. It should also have a scoring system, health, and lives.

The game should include the following, but not limited to:

Player class (movements, speed, jump, health, lives) - Methods
  + Projectile Class (movements, speed, damage) – Methods 
  + Enemy Class (……………….) – Methods
  + Collectible Class (health boost, extra life, etc.,) ------  BS working on collectable class
  + Level Design (3 Levels), Add boss enemy at the end. ------  BS COMPLETED BOSS SPRITE
  + A Scoring system based on enemies defeated, and collectibles collected, health bar for players, and enemies.
  + Implement a game over screen with the option to restart. -------COMPLETE by  BS
  
  Bonus: Create a dynamic camera that follows the players smoothly.
  This is what i have so far Key Components of a Dynamic Camera in Pygame:
     1.Player/Target Positioning: The player or an object acts as the target for the camera, and the camera moves relative to this target's position.
     2.Offset Calculation: Instead of moving the player sprite itself, the camera calculates an offset that shifts all other elements (tiles, backgrounds, enemies) in the opposite direction. The player stays visually centered, while the world scrolls around them.
     3.Viewport Limits: To prevent the camera from going out of bounds (showing empty areas outside the map), you can set limits so the camera stops at the edges of the game world.
     4.Smoothing: Some games implement smooth camera movement (like easing in and out) instead of snapping to the player’s exact position, which gives a more polished, less abrupt effect.
   
• Q3 All the answers and contributions should be recorded in GitHub till you submit the assignment. So we need to be thrashing this notes page

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nothing yet but if something comes up we should keep it front and centre for everyone to get onto ASAP! Or just your current mission...

-BS Updated Lemon guy sprite with object crate class. He can stand on crate and crate explodes and disapears after a second. UPLOADED
     Continueing on with Collectable class, should be finished it today. Then I will be linking in my TKinter image generator to produce custom collectables.
need to confirm if the background graphics are the wrong size because of the camera set up or if I can make them screen size and delete the block that resizes them at the start of game.py.

- BS uploaded image for lives (just a  little lemon guy head
- BS uploaded armory
- BS working on collectables

Background = background1..... BS-this may change using one long set eg like an early mario means each level is graphically unique and since this assinment is about the code I think that time could be spent better so just to cycle tile the background is more efficient.

-BS currently completing backgrounds waiting to figure out dynamic camera to see is we tile or make them world environments.
     have uploaded a draft camera with a draft of stage 1 background ... if we go with tiling... still working on this..
-They are cycled tiles as the moment... need MD to communicate on this
- have a specific scene for the Boss scenes at the moment and can edit as needed.. see ginger peeps file, he has a ginger tree castle.

HEALTH BAR

-MD I wasnt completely sure about the heart/health system but if you could find graphics for a coloured in heart for health and then an uncoloured heart/broken heart for a loss of life that would be epic 
 It should be easy to implement with 2 graphics for health/loss of health just replace heart with broken heart or whatever whenever player takes damage 
 and then reset after each level 

@-MD Health bar images uploaded see Health Bar Images in OBJECTS folder

-MD to code

---------DYNAMIC CAMERA-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-MD

-BS The camera class handles the camera’s position, adjusting its view based on the player and keeping him centre.
    Then define an apply function that shifts all the entities in the game world, moving them backwards away from the lemon guy, who stays in the middle of the screen.
    The camera is limited by xy coordinates, so it doesn't scroll past the edges of the map.
    4. the smoothing option seems like you would just randomly adjust the scaleing of the backgound.

-BS Mostly need to confirm if we can tile bground with this camera option or need a full map modern style
-BS Uploaded a first start. Have the backgound moving instead of the lemon guy

    NEED WORK
