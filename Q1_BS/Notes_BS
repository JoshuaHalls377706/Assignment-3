#Joined will get something down tomorrow!

#For my tkinter app I am working on an image generator that would generate 4 custom tokens that could be unique collectibles in the stages
#This would be a quiz interface with inputs that forced a certain style of output image that would be graphically consistent though a lame quiz entry set up.

#SAM I AM have you ever gamed on a car in a boat on a plane as the weather changes around you??? Could we grab live weather update to alter the background as you play?

#Also have uploaded authtoken.py to authorise hugging face acces to the image generator, should we create a folder for our supporting files to keep this main list neat?
